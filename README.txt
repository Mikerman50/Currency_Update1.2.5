This is an updated version of Jsn_mans Server Currency Mod that was originally made
for minecraft 1.0.0 
http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/643056-100smpbukkitserver-currency-v052wip/page__st__100
My aim with this mod is to expand on what was a great mod but add additional features such 
as sounds and possible ATM machines, with working cards and pin codes that would dispence the
correct ammount asked for in 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000 notes (bills)
